# Project 3: Spots

Project Spots

This project is designed to make it so you can create a profile and add pictures for others to view and like the photos you have posted kind of like facebook. 

We used alot of different techiniques in this the project one of them is the BEM file structure. This makes the css files easier to read and understand whats going on and what to edit. We also used buttons with hover states and smooth transitions and round corners. In these files you will also find media queries that make this more acceptable for mobile devices and easier to follow. 

Below is a link to a figma page that shows what the project looks like for mobile views and desktop viewers. alternatively if anything is broken you can export images/buttons from here to re upload.
